    "\n",
    "1. Set critical parameters:\n",
    "- Total number of students in applicant pool: 100\n",
    "- Number of students in advantaged pool: 50\n",
    "- Number of students in disadvantaged pool: 50\n",
    "- Probability a student has x_i = 1 for x in [1,2] if from advantaged group: 2/3\n",
    "- Probability a student has x_i = 1 for x in [1,2] if from disadvantaged group: 1/3\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initialize student pool based on above parameters.\n",
    "- Note: can use numpy.random() to generate random numbers between 0 and 1, allows us to model simple probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For each of the four scenarios, generate table of student f-value rankings based on x_1 and x_2 for a given student, and include information on whether they are from the advantaged group (A) or disadvantaged group (D).\n",
    "- Scenario 1: Use both x_1 and x_2 information but not group information\n",
    "- Scenario 2: Do not use x_2 and do not use group membership nformation\n",
    "- Scenario 3: Do not use x_2, but use group membership information.\n",
    "- Scenario 4: Use x_2 for students in D but do not use group membership information otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the average f-value for the top 5/18 of the students in the pool for each scenario (efficiency of algorithm). -> 27 students\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Assess the proportion of admitted students in A and D and compare to the proportion of students in the applicant pool from A and D (equity of algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Repeat above analysis (steps 2-5) for a large number of iterations to check if the algorithm converges to the theoretical expectation."
